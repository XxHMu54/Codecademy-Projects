<p>My name is Hamza, I am a cool guy very cool guy. I gotta win and succeed, I love my religion, i know my purpose in life, i may trip, but i will get back and i will fight and succeed. Life can be hard sometimes, but every hardship is followed by ease. Sometimes you want things to go your way and turn out how you want it to be. But that is not what you will find in this world. I think it is us to want that, and i dont think its neccessiraly wrong, but in this world, you gotta realize the obstacles in your life are there to test you, simple. 'm just regretting certain mistakes i have done in the past, but the past doesnt have to define me, the future, the present can, it hurts but i know i can and have the ability to remake my story, and we will, God willing, always</p>
  
<p>Its hard sometimes I know, but just stick to the principles and try, thats all you gotta do. Stand up and be counted.</p>
